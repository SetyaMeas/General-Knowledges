# Fluent Interface

The `Fluent Interface` is an object-oriented API design that allows us to chain method calls together in a readable and intuitive manner. [_refference_](https://www.baeldung.com/java-fluent-interface-vs-builder-pattern)

This concept, created in 2005 by [Eric Evans](https://x.com/ericevans) and [Martin Fowler](https://x.com/martinfowler), aims to increase code readability by creating a domain-specific language (DSL). [_refference_](https://dzone.com/articles/java-fluent-api)

## Implementation

To implement it, we need to declare methods that return objects from the same class. As a result, weâ€™ll be able to chain together multiple method calls. The pattern is often used in building **DSLs** (Domain-Specific Languages). [_refference_](https://www.baeldung.com/java-fluent-interface-vs-builder-pattern)

See the code example _[here](../Java/FluentInterface.md)._
